expending money project using reactjs

I made this project when I finished my first reactjs lesson and I m learning redux now

this game allows you to buy some items with 10000 dollars

I used redux-toolkit
I used reactstrap and my own csses
I used alertifyjs

My faults;

this project wasn't responsive
the same products don't unite in cart
